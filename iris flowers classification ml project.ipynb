    "In this project, we developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their attributes. We preprocessed the data, trained an SVM classifier, and evaluated its performance. By understanding and implementing this project, you gained insights into data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation in a classification problem. Further improvements can be made by trying different algorithms or performing hyperparameter tuning. This project serves as a foundation for more complex machine learning tasks and provides practical experience in applying classification techniques to real-world datasets."
